# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media 📝✨

This project is part of my **Cloudcredits Technologies Internship** (Data Science).  
The goal was to build a **Sentiment Analysis model** that classifies text (positive/negative) using **Machine Learning & NLP techniques**.

---

## 🔹 Steps Performed
1. Data Preprocessing (stopwords removal, tokenization, TF-IDF)
2. Model Training:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Naive Bayes
3. Model Comparison
4. Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

---

## 📊 Results
- **Logistic Regression (tuned): 90% Accuracy**
- **Naive Bayes: 88% Accuracy**

Both models performed well, but Logistic Regression had better balanced precision/recall.

---

## 📈 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- NLP (TF-IDF)

## 📌 Internship
This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship** with Cloudcredits Technologies.  
More tasks will be added to this repository as the internship progresses.
